How to use:

- Generate a salt -- this is a key which you will use to encrypt your passwords.
- Click the 'save salt' button at the top of the screen to save your key for future use you can also use the 'load salt' button to load a previously saved salt.
- Type your desired password into the 'password' field.
- Click 'encrypt' and you'll have an encrypted password.
- You can use the notes page to write your unencrypted passwords, for example, and load them later.

'Extract salt' will remove the key from the password (recommended).

Salts and notes are stored locally in JSON files, therefore, I recommend this program for personal use only. It's best used via a personal USB memory stick.
